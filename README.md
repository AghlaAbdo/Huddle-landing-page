## My process

To tackle the Huddle Landing Page challenge, I followed a step-by-step process to ensure a successful outcome. Here's an overview of my approach:

1. **Understanding the Design**: I carefully reviewed the challenge requirements and studied the provided design files to gain a clear understanding of the project's layout, color scheme, and typography.

2. **HTML Structure**: I started by structuring the HTML elements, focusing on semantic tags and accessibility. This helped me lay a solid foundation for the page's content and structure.

3. **Styling with CSS**: Leveraging my knowledge of CSS, I implemented the styles to replicate the design. I paid attention to details such as fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive layout.

4. **Responsive Design**: To ensure a seamless user experience across different devices, I incorporated responsive design techniques. I utilized media queries and to adapt the page's appearance for various screen sizes.
